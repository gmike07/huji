if we have a range [zi - z(i+1)] that has no pixels in it, then the calculation 
sum p(z) for z in  [zi - z(i+1)]  = 0.
because p(z) = 0 for all z in [zi - z(i+1)]
in our algorithm, we divide by (sum p(z) for z in  [zi - z(i+1)]) to find
qi, therefore, we will divide by 0 and the program will crash. :)
