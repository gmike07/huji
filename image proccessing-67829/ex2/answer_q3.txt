the 2 magnitudes are a bit different because both of them try to approximate
the same picture in different ways. Because they both are approximations they
agree only on the most important details but the little differences  that are
done by the algorithms make them have different answers. The fourier is more
precise by a little bit. the conv dir is just taking the difference for
epsilon=1, while the fourier dir is assuming that the picture is continuous when
it is. Those little problems bring the differences in the pictures.
