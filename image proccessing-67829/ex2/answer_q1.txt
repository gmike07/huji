the 2 audios sound a bit differnt. the reason for the difference is that the
first one just accelerates the speed in which the samples are played (faster, 
slower) which makes it harder to perceive all of the audio. while the second one,
changes the amount of samples that will be played all together, therefore the
second one sounds a bit better because we are used as humans to a certain amount 
of samples per second.
