idea1:

corruption function:
    it chooses randomly a kernel and down samples the current patch with the
    given filter. this is a down scale of the original image with blurring
    which the model gets as an input.
restore image:
    gets a down scaled patch, does everything the same but at the end expands
    it as we have seen in pyramids by adding 0 padding between each 2 elements
    and then doing a convolution.

idea2:

corruption function:
    it chooses randomly a kernel and down samples the current patch with the
    given filter and then upsamples back! this blurs the image.
restore image:
    the restore image doesn't change in this case because it does get the
    correct size to try and improve the resolution upon.
