This exercise has 3 files:

README - this file
AUTHORS - a file that contains the authors of the project
ship.py - a file that handles the ship object
asteroid.py - a file that handles the asteroid object
torpedo.py - a file that handles the torpedo object

======================

special shot: it is a torpedo that moves diffrently.
it chooses the closest meteor and follows it by the next algorithm:
    if the x value are diffrent, fix the x value (by MAX_SPEED or less)
    else fix the y value (by MAX_SPEED or less)
if the asteroid is destroyed not by thus shot, the shot chooses a new target.
