I discussed the exercise with:
=============================
=  README for ex3:          =
=============================

==================
=  Description:  =
==================

This exercise has 3 files:

README - this file
ex3.py - contains a vast amount of utility functions to work with lists
check_maximum.py - check that the function maximum in ex3 works correctly


======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================
in check_maximum:
the first check checks whether the function works with an empty list
the second check checks if the function works correctly with decimal places
the third check checks if the function works correctly with diffrent types of number
the fourth checks if the function works correctly with negative numbers
the fifth checks if the function works correctly with negative numbers, positive ones, and form diffrent types

PART 5:
cyclic(123 ,321) - the inputs will throw an error because it checks length which is underfined for int type
maximum([-3, -2, -1]) - the function will return  -1 because the inputs are valid and the function doesn't assume the input to be positive
maximum([1, 10, 100, 'intro']) - the inputs will throw an error because the function can't check greater than for diffrent types int and str
histogram(3, [1,2,3,4]) - the function will return [0,1,1] because the function create a list only in length 3 therefore 3,4 are ignored and dicounted in the list
prime_factors(0) - the function will return [] because the function checks if the input is less than 2, if so it returns an empty list
pairs([0,0,1,1,2,2], 2) - the function will return  [[0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [1, 1]] because the inputs are valid and
    because the function returns any combination of 2 diffrent elements that meet the requirements
