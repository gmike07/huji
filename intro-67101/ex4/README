I discussed the exercise with:
=============================
=  README for ex1:          =
=============================

==================
=  Description:  =
==================

This exercise has 3 files:

README - this file
hangman.py - a file that handles the logic of the hangman gui
check_update_word_pattern.py - a file that debugs the update_word_pattern
            function in hangman.py

======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================

check_update_word_pattern:

the first check tests if the function can
        access all indexes correctly (the first and last)
the second check test if the function doesn't
        change the pattern when it shouldn't
the third check test if the function changes only
        the correct index that meet the requirements
the fourth check test if the function changes
        the correct indexes that meet the requirements
        when there is more than 1 and not everyone is the same letter

ANSWER TO QUESTIONS:

in order to play the game in hebrew, all that needs to
       be changed is the LETTERS list to hebrew list
        and ORD_A to be the ord of ◊ê instead of a because
        it is the first hebrew letter.
and for the game to work correctly, the words.txt
        should be changed to contain hebrew
        words but it isn't part of the code itself.
