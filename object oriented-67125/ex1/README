=          Design           =
=============================
I just followed the API as instructed, added only 4 more methods. 3 getters in the book class and a function
to calculate the number of borrowed books of a patron



=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
I chose arrays because the pdf taught that and because the size was given from the beginning, else I
would have chosen hashtable
