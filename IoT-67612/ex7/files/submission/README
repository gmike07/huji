    - main.c - This is the main file that the MCU run when turn on.
    - main.h

    - app.c - Helper moudle that make the code mroe organize. In thid moudle we define what will run in each iteration.
    - app.h

----- Brief explanation -----
In this exercise we build a simple program that run on our MCU as the exercise require.
In addition we implement a simple printf library that fit for our screen.

- What we implement?
At the start we print the menu.
When we click BTN0, we start count the number of blinking and print on the screen.
When we click BTN1, we print the HFXO. (If the leds were blinking we stop them.)
* After 10 seconds of no operations, we stop the blinking (the leds stay at the state there were) and print the menu.

----- Program flow -----
1) main is run, and enter the following loop:
2) "app_process_action" is called from "App" module.
3) "ex7_process_action" is called from "ex7_lib" module, and check if it has somethings to do according to the interrupts that happends.
*) Every time that interruped is happened some boolean variables are change, and the "ex7_process_action" function will operate as needed.  
    (We made it in this way in order to make the interrupts call backs as short as possible.)
