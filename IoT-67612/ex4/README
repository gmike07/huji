----- Brief explanation -----
We created "cellular" interface with some functions to communicate with the modem and perform some operation with clean
interface.

In order to run the bonus, please uncomment the relevant part.

----- Program flow -----

1) Connecting to the modem.
2) Verify the connection by sending AT commands.
3) Send "AT+CCID" and extract the CCID.
4) Send "AT+GSN" and extract the IMEI.
5) Send "AT+CREG?" in order to verify the network connection "0,1" or "0,5"
6) Send "AT^SMONI" in order to check that there is an operator that we can connect to.
7) Iterate over all available networks and connect to the first success.
8) Send "AT+CSQ" in order to check the signal quality.
9) Disconnect.
