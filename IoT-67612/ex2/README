----- Brief explanation -----
We created MQTTCtx and MqttNet objects, which needed to connect to the broker.
The MqttNet has some functions that we implement in MQTTCLient.c file, which use our socket from ex1.

Then, we initialized these objects as the wolfMQTT\examples does.

Following the wolfMQTT\examples\mqttclient code that demonstrates the usage of the wolfMQTT library we
Subscribe, Publish, and Read message from the desire topics, as the exercise required.

----- Program flow -----

1) Initializing MQTTCtx and MqttNet objects.
1.1) Assign to the MqttNet our implemented function.
2) Subscribe to the desire topic.
3) Publish the first message.
4) Publish the second message.
5) Receive message.
6) Publish the third message.
7) Disconnect.
