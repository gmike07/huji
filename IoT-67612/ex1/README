----- Files in the project: -----
    - socket.c: A socket component, Used to read and write any text data from a given host.
    - socket.h

    -  HTTP_client.c: A HTTP component, Used to communicate with some host by using the HTTP protocol.
    - HTTP_client.h

    - main.c: Test file, to check our implementation, as the exercise require.
    - README: Project description file.

----- Brief explanation -----
We created 2 different components, The socket and the HTTP_client.
* The Http_client component is relies on the Socket one, By referring to it as a "black box" that can read and write any
text data to a given host.
The main responsibility of the Http_client is to communicate with the Http protocol, and it doing that by relying on
the Socket component.

* The Socket component is  deliver some simple API of the Socket library in c.


----- Program flow -----
When the user use one of the Http_client function, the flow goes as following:
    1) The Http_client component take the properties of the request that the user set (e.g The URL) and "translate" the
        request to HTTP form. Doing that with preset hard-coded template of the desire HTTP request.
    2) Use the socket component to deliver the request.
    3) Use the socket component to read the response.
    4) Extract the "real" data from the response (without all Http headers and etc')
    5) Return the data.
