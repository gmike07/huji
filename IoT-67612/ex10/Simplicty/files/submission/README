----- Brief explanation -----
In this exercise we implement a serail comunication using USART.
We use the IOStream libary in order to do that.
We implement serial_io which contains some basic function that help us communicate with USART.
In addition we implement the main file, that run a basic program flow (as the exercise require) and test our serial implementation.

----- Program flow -----
1) main is run, and enter the following loop:
2) "app_process_action" is called from "App" module.
And implement the following inerupts:
- Every 10 seconds that passed, we print to the screen the number of times BTN0 is pressed.
- Every time BTN0 is pressed we update the counter for BTN0.
- Every time BTN1 is pressed we send through "Serial_io" a message that contains the number of times BTN0 was pressed. 
  The sending process is done with interupts tha the IOStream implement for us.

In additionn the IOStream implement for us an interupts that handle the receing data, so we only comunicate with Serial_io in order to get a data that we recieved.
