ANSWERS:


Assignment 1:
Steps we did to figure out what the program does:
-Run the command chmod +x ./WhatIDo to make the
 program executable.
-Run the command ./WhatIDo and get the output
 “The program should receive an argument”.
-Run the command ./WhatIDo input and get no output.
-Run the command strace ./WhatIDo input
 and get a description of what the program does.
-Run the command strace -s 500 ./WhatIDo input
and get full description of what the program does.


The program executes:
if there is no input it prints enter an input and exits
else:
-Open a directory called “Welcome”
-Inside it, open a directory called “To”
-Inside it, open a file “OS2020”
-Write to it “%s\nIf you haven't read the course
guidelines yet --- do it right now!\n%s”,
when the first string is the username of the host
and the second one is the input argument.
-Close the file
-Delete the file
-Delete the directory “To”
-Delete the directory “Welcome”
-Exit with 0
